/**
 * Represents a B+ Tree data structure for storing and managing sorted data.
 * This class provides the foundational structure for a B+ Tree, which is commonly
 * used in database systems and file systems to organize and retrieve data efficiently.
 *
 * @fields
 * - `root` (BPlusTreeNode): The root node of the B+ Tree. Initially set to `null`.
 *
 * @constructor
 * - `BPlusTree()`: Initializes an empty B+ Tree with no root.
 *
 * @example
 * ```java
 * BPlusTree tree = new BPlusTree();
 * System.out.println("B+ Tree initialized with root: " + tree.root);
 * ```
 *
 * @note Further methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal would typically
 *       be implemented to fully utilize the B+ Tree structure.
